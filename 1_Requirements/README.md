**DESCRIPTION**
-


   A calculator is a device use to do some basic mathematical operations. This include  **addition** , **substraction** , **division** and **multiplication** . In this project, I will add some additional  mathematical operations that are use in mathematical world. This includes Sin function, Cos function, Power, Factorial, etc. In this project, the user is going to enter numbers of his/her desire.

**HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT**
-
|Test ID  |    Description  |  
-------------|-----------------------------------
|HL01     |    The calculator must perform all the operations. | 
|HL02     |    The calculator must perform all the operations. |
|HL03     |    The calculator must give corrent result.        |
|HL04     |    There should not be any delay in operation and result.      |

**LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENT**
-
|Test ID   |  Description | 
------------------|-------------------
|LL01     | The user must use **(** or **)** to do operation between two perticular number.|
|LL02     | The number when given to sin and cos function must be in radian.|

**SWOT ANALYSIS**
-
__STRENGTHS__

Can perform operations instantly which saves the time of the user and it is very handy.

**WEAKNESSES**

Contains certain number of operators only which restricts the user.

**OPPORTUNITIES**

It is an absolute requirement nowadays. By adding other mathematical operators can make it versitile than others

**THREATS**

The technological developement in this field is slow compare to other fields of technology.

**WHO**

 - This project is purely handeled by me and whatever happens, I am responsible for that.
 
 **WHAT**
 
 - Calculator is a basic need nowadays, so, I am building a basic calculator to do some mathematical calculations with different operators.
 
 **WHEN**
 
 - This project has been done between 3rd of february 2022 and 10th of february 2022.
 
 **WHERE**
 
 - This project has been done in vs code.

**HOW**

- I am doing this project using C language. I am using do while loop and switch break statement to select an operation to be perform as desired by the user.
