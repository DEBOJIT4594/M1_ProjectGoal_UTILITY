**DESCRIPTION**
-


   A calculator is a device use to do some basic mathematical operations. This include **addition**, **substraction**, **division** and **multiplication**. In this project, I will add some additional  mathematical operations that are use in mathematical world. This includes Sin function, Cos function, Power, Factorial, etc.
   
   In this project, the user is going to enter numbers of his/her desire. 

**HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT**
-

- The calculator must perform all the operations.
- The calculator must give corrent result.
- There should not be any delay in operation and result.

**LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENT**
-


**SWOT ANALYSIS**
-

__STRENGTHS__

Can perform operations instantly which saves the time of the user and it is very handy.

**WEAKNESSES**

Contains certain number of functions only which restricts the user.

**OPPORTUNITIES**

It is an absolute requirement nowadays. By adding other mathematical operators can make it versitile than others

**THREATS**

The technological developement in this field is slow compare to other fields of technology.
